## Harmonic Analysis Constants ##

CUTOFF = 2
# This means only chords that match for at least of their notes
# will be accepted as candidates.

DOMINANT_DENSITY = 0.30
TONIC_DENSITY = 0.80
# If TONIC_DENSITY = 0.40 then 40% of measures identified as potential 
# tonic chords will actually become them. The rest will chosen like
# all other chords.

SEVENTH_DENSITY = 0.60
# Works as a limiter on the number of seventh chords, since they
# generally have higher rates of matching than triads. Lower values
# for this constant means lower amounts of seventh chords.


### PITCH PROGRESSIONS ###

# In order of descending strength:
# The float in parentheses corresponds to the
# "strength" of the progression. The higher the
# rating, the more confidence there is that this
# scale is indeed the appropriate one. 

# Essentially certain #
# All 1,1	All 7,1		All 2,1
# All 5,1	All 4,3
# For example, "'B', 'A', 'G'" (3,2,1) will always return G major
